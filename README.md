# evolutionary-selection

This repository provides the MATLAB scripts used to obtain the results featured in the paper _Competition and evolutionary selection among core regulatory motifs in gene expression control_. In particular, code corresponding to 
* deterministic simulations in large populations can be found in the folder **deterministic**;
* stochastic sampling in small populations can be found in the folder **sampling**;
* diffusion approximation in small populations can be found in the folder **diffusion**;
* statistical analysis can be found in the folder **statistics**.
