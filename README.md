# evolutionary-selection

This repository provides the MATLAB scripts used to obtain the results featured in the paper _Competition and evolutionary selection among core regulatory motifs in gene expression control_. In particular, code corresponding to 
* deterministic simulations in large populations (e.g., Fig. 3 and 6) can be found in the folder **deterministic**;
* stochastic sampling in small populations (e.g., Fig. 4, 5 and 7) can be found in the folder **sampling**;
* diffusion approximation in small populations (e.g., Fig. 4) can be found in the folder **diffusion**;
* statistical analysis (e.g., Fig. 8) can be found in the folder **statistics**.
