# evolutionary-selection

This repository provides the MATLAB scripts used to obtain the results featured in the paper _Competition and evolutionary selection among core regulatory motifs in gene expression control_. In particular, code corresponding to 
* deterministic simulationss in large populations can be found in the folder **large population**;
* stochastic sampling in small populations can be found in the folder **stochastic sampling**;
* diffusion approximation in small populations can be found in the folder **diffusion approximation**;
* how positive and negative autoregulation have drastically different impact on the population composition can be found in the folder **unwanted selection pressure**;
* how delay can negatively impact the performance of autoregulated motifs can be found in the folder **delay**;
* how feedback cost can cause non-autoregulated motifs to outperform autoregulation can be found in the folder **expensive control**;
* the statistical analysis can be found in the folder **statistics**.
